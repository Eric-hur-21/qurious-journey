# Welcome to my Quantum Computing & Engineering Journey! 

Hi! I’m Eric Hur, a physics major at the University of Washington, Seattle.
This repository is my open notebook as I explore the full stack of quantum computing — from hardware fundamentals to software development.

## Mission
My goal is to build a strong foundation in quantum hardware (with a focus on trapped-ion architectures) while also developing the software engineering skills needed to interface with quantum devices.

Quantum computing isn’t just about algorithms — it’s about understanding how qubits are built, controlled, and applied. Inspired by Richard Feynman’s vision, I see quantum computers as tools to simulate nature and uncover the deeper truths of the universe. And also prepare future generation with tools for an exciting future!
